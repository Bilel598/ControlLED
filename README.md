# ControlLED
This SpringBoot app will send to a Broker server (here my pc so localhost) "ON" or "OFF" to control a LED plugged to a Raspberry Pi. 
On the Raspberry, you must have a Subscriber app which will read the message sent by this application, and control the light. 
You can find the subscriber programm in my other repo.
